        Who are we
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text">We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world</h2>
    
    <p class="text"> Riot Games was founded in 2006 to develop, publish, and support the most player-focused games in the world. <br>
        In 2009, we released our debut title, League of Legends, to worldwide acclaim. League has gone on to be the <br>
        most-played PC game in the world and a key driver of the explosive growth of esports. With League in its second <br> decade,
        we're continuing to evolve the game while delivering new experiences to players with Teamfight Tactics, <br>
        Legends of Runeterra, VALORANT, League of Legends: Wild Rift, and multiple work-in-progress titles.<br>
        In addition, Riot Forge gives developers access to Riot’s IP to create games like Ruined King and <br>
        plenty of other adventures across Runeterra. We’re also expanding the world of Runeterra through multimedia <br>
        projects across music, comic books, board games, and Arcane, our Emmy Award-winning animated series.</p>
